    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project, Cpp-KitLearn, aims to implement popular machine learning algorithms, data manipulation techniques, and deep learning frameworks in C++. Inspired by the functionality of Python libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas, this project seeks to provide C++ implementations for these essential tools. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive library that offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Implementing algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression in C++.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Providing tools for predicting continuous values using algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression.</li>
        <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Offering clustering algorithms like k-Means, HDBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering for grouping similar objects.</li>
        <li><strong>NumPy:</strong> Recreating the functionality of NumPy in C++ for numerical operations, including array manipulation and linear algebra.</li>
        <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Implementing data manipulation and analysis tools similar to Pandas for efficient data handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Calculation:</strong> Providing methods to evaluate the performance of models, including metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 score.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Creating a framework for deep learning techniques, leveraging the power of neural networks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each section links to detailed pages containing C++ code and documentation to demonstrate the implementation of these algorithms and tools. The project aims to make machine learning accessible to C++ developers, promoting the use of C++ in data science and machine learning fields.</p>
